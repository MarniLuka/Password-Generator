# Password Generator with Starter Code

## Description

We were (helpfully) given a starter code of HTML, CSS, and parts of JavaScript. We had to add code to the JavaScript to create a random password generator. This helped sharpen our current skills using JavaScript and even learned new skills to help make the code work.

## Usage

Upon opening the website and clicking on the "Generate Password" button, you will be given a series of prompts so that you can get a random password based off of your input. 

The password must be between 8 and 128 characters long. If it is shorter or longer than the given parameters, you cannot generate a password. 

The series of prompts ask you if you would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in your password. You may chose to include as little or as many as you like, but you must chose one. If none are chosen, you cannot generate a password.

## Credits

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4HUaiazDes) was provided by the instructor to watch to give us an idea of how we should go about solving the problem in the code.

I watched this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2jfGo7ztm8) to give me an idea on how to start, but didn't fully watch it as I wanted to try and figure it out myself.

I also watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rq_LrpcgIM) to help explain how to generate a random number.

[Alex Seidensticker](https://github.com/koi-as), another member of the bootcamp class, helped me debug my code concerning the random generator to get it working.
